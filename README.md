# ii_dodeca
Turning the dodeca eurorack module into a ii follower, which can be controlled via monome crow.

The [dodeca](https://github.com/MagpieModular/Dodeca) by Magpie Modular and Neutron Sound is a eurorack module intended to work together as an eurorack extension for the elektron octatrack.
This alternative firmware turns it into an [ii](https://monome.org/docs/modular/ii) (i2c) follower, so that the module can be controlled by ii leaders such as the [monome crow](https://monome.org/docs/crow/).

This firmware takes inspiration from the [ii expanders](https://github.com/bpcmusic/telex) origianlly designed for the monome teletype
